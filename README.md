# anchorageproperties

## nascent topic ideas
1. I want to design a map that provides insight into the property market and inventory in Anchorage...
2. because I want to find out why homes are not affordable or abundant enough for the city's population...
3. in order to help the user understand how we got where we are and hopefully ideas for moving forward.

## potential data
There is a wealth of property data at data.muni.org, and I'm already familiar with it from work.
