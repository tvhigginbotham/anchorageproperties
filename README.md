## Draft topic and description
Working title (final title will be subtantially different): Construction Growth in Girdwood, Alaska

Description: An analysis of building over time in the small resort town of Girdwood, Alaska, on the outskirts of the Municipality of Anchorage. This project will look at the raw growth of structures, the types of structures being built, and the changes in the market since roughly 1970. Hopefully it will provide insight into the town and illustrate its slow transformation from an underdeveloped, accessible winter playground to an exclusive, high-income resort destination, blocking access to Alaska's nature to many.

## potential data
There is a wealth of property data at data.muni.org, and I'm already familiar with it from work.
https://data.muni.org/Housing-and-Homelessness/CAMA-Property-Inventory-Residential-and-Commercial/yfin-h3vh
https://data.muni.org/Housing-and-Homelessness/Girdwood-Residential-Value-Bedrooms-example-/6dj9-bj4e

This data needs to be filtered to only Girdwood properties and narrowed down to the most relevant details, which I am still considering. It will need to be joined with spatial data matched by Parcel ID number, which I will be able to access through the Muni, but have not yet located.
